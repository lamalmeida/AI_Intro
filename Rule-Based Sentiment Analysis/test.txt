the worst films of 2002|-1
have infused Frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character 's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own|1
what an idea , what a thrill ride . This is a more fascinating look at the future than '' Bladerunner '' and one of the most high-concept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen .|1
is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice .|1
is a remarkable piece of filmmaking|1
are incredibly captivating and insanely funny ,|1
even Elizabeth Hurley seem graceless and ugly|-1
Haneke 's script ( from Elfriede Jelinek 's novel ) is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending .|-1
It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and I think even fans of Sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting|-1
's almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images|1
putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .|-1
and thoroughly delightful|1
An unclassifiably awful study in self - and audience-abuse .|-1
An enjoyable comedy of lingual and cultural differences ... The Ch�teau is a film -- full of life and small delights -- that has all the wiggling energy of young kitten .|1
Philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess .|-1
, but the miracle of Shainberg 's film is that it truly is romance|1
the year 's most thought-provoking film|1
's extreme , all right . Extremely dumb . Extremely confusing . Extremely boring .|-1
poorly thought-out and substance-free|-1
, bad , bad movie|-1
, the film is typical Miike : fast , furious and full of off-the-cuff imaginative flourishes .|1
an absolute delight for all audiences|1
a powerful sequel and one of the best films of the year .|1
I laughed throughout the movie|1
one of those reputedly '' unfilmable '' novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right|1
you just have to love the big , dumb , happy movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding|1
'll only put you to sleep .|-1
If you 're not deeply touched by this movie , check your pulse .|1
the absolute top|1
A triumph of art direction over narrative , but what art direction !|1
hugely rewarding experience|1
too boring and obvious|-1
The actors are fantastic .|1
is powerful and revelatory|1
As aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice|-1
, this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .|-1
it 's a heck of a ride . Samuel L . Jackson is one of the best actors there is|1
inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot|-1
Calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment|-1
adultery|-1
'' appalling|-1
's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish . Not only is entry number twenty the worst of the Brosnan bunch|-1
It 's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , AND satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but Minority Report delivers all that and a whole lot more .|1
demonstrates that the director of such Hollywood blockbusters as Patriot Games can still turn out a small , personal film with an emotional wallop .|1
A superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' : Everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place ,|-1
Skip this dreck|-1
That rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults|1
This pathetic junk|-1
loved this film|1
achieves ultimate insignificance|-1
, Standing in the Shadows of Motown is cultural history of the best kind : informative , revealing and richly entertaining .|1
a spectacular piece|1
Was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ?|-1
Channel 5 grade trash|-1
A deliciously nonsensical comedy about a city coming apart at its seams .|1
Degenerates into hogwash .|-1
in gorgeous visuals|1
would n't matter so much that this arrogant Richard Pryor wannabe 's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny|-1
that propels her into the upper echelons of the directing world|1
'll find yourself remembering this refreshing visit to a Sunshine State|1
there 's no saving the movie|-1
idiots who do n't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance|-1
plays like an extended dialogue exercise in Retard 101|-1
you 've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie|-1
played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes|1
Meeting , even exceeding expectations , it 's the best sequel since The Empire Strikes Back ... a majestic achievement , an epic of astonishing grandeur and surprising emotional depth .|1
One of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies I|-1
too , thanks to strong , credible performances from the whole cast|1
upper west sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute .|-1
became mad that I wasted 123 minutes and $ 9.50 on this 21st century|-1
A terrific date movie|1
a train wreck of an action film|-1
, scathing and joyous . It 's a masterpeice .|1
that there 's no plot in this Antonio Banderas-Lucy Liu faceoff . It 's still terrible|-1
Ballistic : Ecks Vs . Sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .|-1
a critical and commercial disaster|-1
the same teenage American road-trip drek we 've seen before|-1
they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare|-1
the same tired old gags , modernized for the extreme sports generation . There 's already been too many of these films ...|-1
far superior|1
cinematic intoxication , a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama , tastelessness and swooning elegance|1
love him|1
After seeing the film , I can tell you that there 's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it .|-1
One of the most exciting action films to come out of China in recent years|1
Whether it 's the worst movie of 2002 , I ca n't say for sure : Memories of Rollerball have faded , and I skipped Country Bears . But this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .|-1
it 's almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images .|1
obnoxious 88-minute infomercial|-1
of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness|-1
Director Juan Jose Campanella could have turned this into an Argentine retread of `` Iris '' or `` American Beauty , '' but instead pulls a little from each film and creates something more beautiful than either of those films .|1
Arguably the best script that Besson has written in years .|1
One of those terrific documentaries that collect a bunch of people who are enthusiastic about something and then figures out how to make us share their enthusiasm .|1
Extremely boring|-1
this is the ultimate movie experience|1
powerful enough to leave the screen sizzling with intrigue|1
, the update is dreary and sluggish .|-1
Plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo .|-1
If this is cinema , I pledge allegiance to Cagney and Lacey .|-1
Hollywood Ending is the most disappointing Woody Allen movie ever . He has a great cast and a great idea . But the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work|-1
I did n't laugh . I did n't smile .|-1
One-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation ... Stylistically , the movie is a disaster|-1
me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes|-1
Good car chases , great fight scenes ,|1
You really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they 'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this .|-1
For most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence .|-1
It 's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical .|-1
rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year|1
A shambles of a movie -- visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly|-1
one of the all-time great apocalypse movies|1
emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right|1
have been one of the more daring and surprising American movies of the year|1
laughed that hard in years|1
Slap her - she 's not funny ! No French people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half .|-1
This delicately observed story , deeply felt and masterfully stylized|1
The history is fascinating ; the action is dazzling|1
A terrible movie|-1
Thanks to confident filmmaking and a pair of fascinating performances|1
any of these performances as award-worthy|1
one of those rare docs that paints a grand picture of an era and makes the journey feel like a party|1
It 's drab . It 's uninteresting .|-1
a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $ 9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life|-1
I can take infantile humor ... but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer 's diapers|-1
cinema 's finest this year .|1
Nonsensical , dull `` cyber-horror '' flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting .|-1
The moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess 's home video of their baby 's birth .|-1
is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film The Sum of All Fears , starring Ben Affleck , seem downright Hitchcockian .|-1
A masterful film from a master filmmaker|1
, the film is deadly dull|-1
horrible|-1
Just about the best straight-up , old-school horror film of the last 15 years .|1
finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from Oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack .|-1
is simply brilliant|1
also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were .|-1
stellar performance|1
as lax and limp a comedy as I 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material|-1
full of memorable performances from top to bottom|1
Exciting and well-paced .|1
overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary . Hmmm|-1
A deviant topical comedy which is funny from start to finish .|1
best dramatic performance|1
Best of all is Garcia , who perfectly portrays the desperation of a very insecure man .|1
made for the `` XXX '' crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction|-1
has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad Blair Witch Project|-1
quite one of the worst movies of the year|-1
Waste of Time|-1
the funniest movie of the year|1
For a story set at sea , Ghost Ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed ` surprises . '|-1
How did it ever get made ?|-1
A dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours ... a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle .|-1
a plotline that 's as lumpy as two-day old porridge ... the filmmakers ' paws , sad to say , were all over this `` un-bear-able '' project !|-1
excellent performances|1
is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema . He allows his cast members to make creative contributions to the story and dialogue . This method almost never fails him , and it works superbly here .|1
wildly alive|1
is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that|-1
A moving and important film|1
connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes|-1
has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who are n't looking for them .|-1
We do n't get paid enough to sit through crap like this|-1
easily one of the best films of the year|1
of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies I 've had in a while|1
A woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite Iwai 's vaunted empathy .|-1
that 's got oodles of style and substance|1
made a remarkable film that explores the monster 's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted|1
is hollow , self-indulgent , and - worst of all - boring|-1
is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills|-1
directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory .|-1
The enjoyable Undercover Brother , a zany mix of Saturday Night Live-style parody , '70s Blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy gone wild , dishes out a ton of laughs that everyone can enjoy .|1
Metropolis you hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles|1
it is a great film .|1
dreadful|-1
A masterpiece four years in the making .|1
you crave Chris Smith 's next movie|1
Rather less than the sum of its underventilated p�re-fils confrontations|-1
, this too-long , spoofy update of Shakespeare 's Macbeth does n't sustain a high enough level of invention .|-1
is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else|1
Never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful|-1
absolutely no meaning|-1
a terrific flick|1
his characters are acting horribly|-1
I love the opening scenes of a wintry New York City in 1899 . Cinematic poetry showcases the city 's old-world charm before machines change nearly everything .|1
director Shekhar Kapur supplies with tremendous skill|1
be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls|-1
Oscar-worthy|1
One of the greatest romantic comedies|1
The long-range appeal of '' Minority Report '' should transcend any awards it bags . This is one for the ages .|1
is about the worst thing Chan has done in the United States .|-1
Amazing !|1
Aside from being the funniest movie of the year , Simone , Andrew Niccol 's brilliant anti-Hollywood satire , has a wickedly eccentric enchantment to it .|1
priceless entertainment|1
fascinating and|1
one of the most ingenious and entertaining thrillers I 've seen in quite a long time .|1
for those for whom the name Woody Allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , Hollywood Ending is a depressing experience|-1
of this year 's very best pictures|1
really , really , really good things can come in enormous packages|1
most brilliant|1
Another boorish movie from the I-heard-a-joke - at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting .|-1
, not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment|1
is pathetic !|-1
It 's a movie -- and an album -- you wo n't want to miss|1
juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy|-1
If you 're the kind of parent who enjoys intentionally introducing your kids to films which will cause loads of irreparable damage that years and years of costly analysis could never fix|-1
